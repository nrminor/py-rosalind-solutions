# [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/tree-view/) Bioinformatics Challenge Solutions: An Indirect Path

Like how fly-fishing is not the direct path to catching a fish but is gratifying in other ways, I'm using these challenges both to brush up on Python generally and also to practice a few other things:

-   functional programming idioms like recursive functions and pattern matching
-   dataclass usage
-   fluent interface pipelines, where possible
-   Polars expressions, again where possible
-   test-driven development with `pytest`
-   environment management with `uv`
-   Vim and/or Helix keybindings
-   &c.

For these reasons, this is repo is a maximalist approach to Rosalind problems, where each problem is an opportunity to solve the problem itself, but also to get more reps in on the above items. Look elsewhere for a minimalist approach, where each problem is solved in as few of lines as possible.

The code here was predominantly written in the [Zed editor](https://zed.dev/), with Python dependencies supplied by PyPI via [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). Code was linted and formatted with [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) and tested, more or less exhaustively, with [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/).
